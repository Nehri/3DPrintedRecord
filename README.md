# DIY Record-Making #
### Using 3D Printers, Laser Cutters, and Rubber Molds ###

### By Steven Hernandez, Michelle Ross, and Aaron Schaer ###

This project ports the 3D Printing Record project by Amanda Ghassaei (http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Record/) to Python, with permission under the GNU General Public License. The purpose of this project is to turn digital audio files into formats for 3D printing or laser cutting. Our port provides simple syntax for usage, support for both MP3 and WAV formats, and the option to output to a laser-cuttable PDF rather than Ghassaei's STL limitation.

Please see https://goo.gl/2bcnnV for our analysis of the finished pieces.
